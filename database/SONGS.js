Oh, oh, oh\nThat I could see you throw your jacket on the floor\nI could see you make me want you even more\nWhat would you do, baby, if you only knew?\nThat I can see you\nUh-uh, uh, uh\nI could see you in your suit and your necktie\nPassed me a note saying, \"Meet me tonight\"\nThen we kiss, and you know I won't ever tell, yeah\nAnd I could see you being my addiction\nYou can see me as a secret mission\nHide away and I will start behaving myself\nUh-uh, uh, uh\nOh-oh, oh, oh\nI can see you waitin' down the hall from me\nAnd I could see you up against the wall with me\nAnd what would you do, baby, if you only knew?

      "I know that you like me\nAnd it's kinda frightening\nStanding here waiting, waiting\nAnd I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes\nTongue tied\nBut, now, you're so far away and I'm down\nFeeling like a face in the crowd\nI'm reaching for you, terrified\n\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nI could be the one that you dream of\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\nYou could be the one that I keep\nAnd I could be the reason you can't sleep at night\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\n\nThese days I'm restless\nWorkdays are endless\nLook how you made me, made me\nBut time moves faster\nReplaying your laughter\nDisaster\n\n'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down\nFeeling like a face in the crowd\nI'm reaching for you, terrified\n\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nAnd I could be the one that you dream of\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\nYou could be the one that I keep\nAnd I could be the reason you can't sleep at night\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\n\nHow is it in London? (London)\nWhere were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)\nIf I'll ever see you again?\n\nYou could be the one that I love\nAnd, now, I'm standing here hoping it gets to you\n\n'Cause you could be the one that I love\nI could be the one that you dream of\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\nYou could be the one that I keep\nAnd I could be the reason you can't sleep at night\nA message in a bottle is all I can do\nStanding here hoping it gets to you\n\nYou could be the one that I love\nYou could be the one that I love\nMy love\nAnd, now, I'm standing here hoping this gets to you\n",

      "Rain, he wanted it comfortable\nI wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride\nI was making my own name\nChasing that fame\nHe stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight\nMy town was a wasteland\nFull of cages, full of fences\nPageant queens and big pretenders\nBut for some, it was paradise\nMy boy was a montage\nA slow-motion, love potion\nJumping off things in the ocean\nI broke his heart 'cause he was nice\nHe was sunshine, I was midnight rain\nHe wanted it comfortable\nI wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride\nI was making my own name\nChasing that fame\nHe stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight\nIt came like a postcard\nPicture perfect, shiny family\nHoliday, peppermint candy\nBut for him it's every day\nSo I peered through a window\nA deep portal, time travel\nAll the love we unravel\nAnd the life I gave away\n'Cause he was sunshine\nI was midnight rain\nHe wanted it comfortable\nI wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride\nI was making my own name\nChasing that fame\nHe stayed the same\nAll of me changed\nLike midnight\nRain, he wanted it comfortable\nI wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride\nI was making my own name\nChasing that fame\nHe stayed the same\nAll of me changed\nLike midnight\nI guess sometimes we all get\nJust what we wanted, just what we wanted\nAnd he never thinks of me\nExcept when I'm on TV\nI guess sometimes we all get\nSome kind of haunted, some kind of haunted\nAnd I never think of him\nExcept on midnights like this (midnights like this)",
